# StrobeController
This code is designed for the Strobe Controller project, which includes design and building of hardware, as well as the software contained in this repository. The Strobe Controller is a small, lightweight, low power lighting controller intended for use with LED modules, and which has multiple modes of operation controlled by a matrix keypad. This code is designed for an Arduino Nano installed in a Strobe Controller shield.

The rest of this project is documented on Instructables. The expected date of publication of the article is 30 August 2016.
